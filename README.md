## Assumptions/Notes

- Not enough time to fix parsing to make sure it reads the input in batches
- Not enough time to make sure docker actually builds the code, so currently local machine builds the code and copies it there
- Because of privacy concerns I won't share this code on github even though this is a requirement, all the code that I write is confidential
- More testing is needed but not enough time to add them
  - e.g. full E2E integration tests
